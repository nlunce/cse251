# Lesson 1 Prove: Drawing Shapes

### Overview

Your first assignment is to draw shapes on the screen. When you download the file [lesson_01/prove/prove.py](../prove/prove.py), and run it. It will create the following drawing on the screen. Your task is to use threads for the drawing.

### Assignment

1. Open **ONLY** the `lesson_01/prove` folder in VS Code. This is important for the `prove.py` file to find `cse251turtle.py`. Here are two methods of opening a folder in VSCode.
	- On the Visual Studio menu bar, choose `File > Open > Folder`, and then browse to the code location.
	- On the context (right-click) menu of a folder containing code, choose the Open in Visual Studio command.
    - **NOTE:** If you are comfortable running everything from the terminal you may do that as well, allowing you to keep the entire repo open in VS Code.
2. Run `prove.py`. It will draw the shapes in the image above. These shapes are drawn without using threads. Each type of shape is drawn one at a time - one after the other. Here are the functions used for drawing.

	```python
	draw_squares(tur)
	draw_circles(tur)
	draw_triangles(tur)
	draw_rectangles(tur)
	```

3. Look for `TODO` comments in the program. You will be creating and executing 4 threads. Each thread will call one of the `draw_?(tur)` functions above. For example one thread calls `draw_squares()`, another calls `draw_circles()`, and so on. Your goal is not to draw the shapes in the same order as the non-threaded function, but to end up with the same results. The threads must be running concurrently and take turns drawing their shape. For example, you should see some (not all) squares drawn, then circles, then rectangles, then squares again, then triangles, etc. You can create extra functions if required.
4. You should not change any of the `Log` statements in the assignment. See below section on the Logger class. In addition to not changing the log statements:
    - You are not allowed to use any other Python modules/packages than the packages currently imported.
    - You can create other functions if needed.
    - You can not use or create global variables.

### CSE 251 Logger

This assignment uses the Log class found in `cse251.py`. Refer to the [log class documentation](../canvas/package.md) for more information.

The prove assignment program will creating the following logging information. Here is the output from the assignment program before adding threads:

```text
14:25:40| Start Drawing No Threads
14:25:40| All drawing commands have been created = 0.16962150
14:25:40| Number of Drawing Commands: 1047
14:25:59| At end of drawing = 18.68426980
14:25:59| Start Drawing With Threads
14:25:59| All drawing commands have been created = 0.13810690
14:25:59| Number of Drawing Commands: 1047
14:26:17| At end of drawing = 18.32737350

```

### Rubric

Assignments are not accepted late. Instead, you should submit what you have completed by the due date for partial credit.

Assignments are individual and not team based. Any assignments found to be plagiarized will be graded according to the `ACADEMIC HONESTY` section in the syllabus. The Assignment will be graded in broad categories as outlined in the syllabus:

### Submission

When finished, upload your Python file `prove.py` to Canvas.
